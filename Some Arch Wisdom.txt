(BONUS(actually not so much) Type in ILoveCandy in [options] section of /etc/pacman.conf

-1. Use pacstrap -iKP for:
    i = Get package confirmation prompts
    K = Initialize empty keyring
    P = Copy host pacman config(for when you're installing from another installation and you want to copy your config over)

0. Set ParallelDownloads to at least 5 or lesser for faster package downloads.
   Check out /etc/pacman.conf for more options and configure as you want.
   Don't forget to disable the flags you don't need to compile in /etc/makepkg.conf ,
   Read https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg

1. Don't install kernel headers if you don't need it.

2. Don't install 32 bit libraries unless you need it. Use 64.

3. Set your locale correctly(whether as user or admin) and it's best to ensure perfect sync with one specific locale.

4. Don't blindly install from the AUR. ALWAYS read your PKGBUILDs unless you know what you're doing/the source is trustable.

5. Use paru and bat(for color) for easy PKGBUILD reviewing.

5. Install downgrade, convenient for one single-specific package downgrade.

6. Learn to use the Arch Linux Archive(ALA) properly along with its use in pacman.conf and snapshots, Arch wouldn't be Arch without it.
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_Archive
   
   Pro-tip(Unless necessary, from personal experience one only needs to set [extra] repo to an ALA snapshot to downgrade stuff 
   and leave the core packages and libraries alone. Unless you need to downgrade [core] as well in which case, do it via live usb.
   
   Don't forget to enable [community] repo from ALA if downgrading even more earlier 2023 {Eg, KDE Plasma 5.27} although I doub't you'll need it.
   
   
7. If doing a reinstall of Arch, depending on your reason:
    i)Backup your config files and personal data
    (mostly /etc (including /etc/pacman.d /etc/pacman.conf /etc/makepkg.conf andother Arch related config files), /home and /boot/grub, 
    your untracked configs at /usr/share/).
    
    ii)Backup your package lists: See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Backup (and #Clean the filesystem)

8. CPUPower-GUI is excellent tool for managing CPU performance, or you can use regular CPUPower for use in-terminal. 
   Use its systemd user service along with a profile of your choice to boot with cpu parameters for your user only, keeps thing clean and safe,
   instead of implementing system-wide.
   
9. If using Plasma, you can use KDE Menu Editor to edit your app icons in the Application Launcher, including categories.

10. Emulators work best on Linux and Linux gaming is best on Latest wine and emulator software, so Arch is your Linux for the job.

11. Icon themes are not guranteed to work in all Desktop Environments, so don't blame the system when it shows the wrong icons, 
    provided it's through no fault of its own.

12. Use wine-cachyos{from CachyOS OS, google to set it up) or wine-ge(either with Lutris or system-wide,
    (you're on your own either way and further guidance is beyond the scope of this file)).
    See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wine
    The official package from Arch is the wine-devel version and is simply named wine.
    

13. Use Vesktop(Flatpak(added privacy ;) ). Execellent client with screensharing.

14. GRUB is efficient and is well documented and supported across all Distros. Including boot repair. Run grub-mkconfig after install.
    Install os-prober and efibootmgr and enable OS-Prober from /etc/default/grub for it to detect other OSes.

15. Need swap? Swapfile, read https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Swap_file_creation 
    Also see Hibernation(Excellent quality of life tool): https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hibernation

16. Install the necessary archiving libraries(unrar,unzip,etc) Hint: It'll be present as an optional install when you install GUI packages like ark

17. Don't forget to configure your network before reobooting after install,
    (Install Network-manager and enable service or use systemd-networkd) Also wpa_supplicant for wireless)

18. Systemd-timesyncd for simple Desktops where you just want to see the time and do nothing else.
    Chrony for servers and time-based, intensive or critical workloads and use-cases.

19. Don't install unnecessary packages, don't install too much bleeding edge, 
    learn to stick with what works but also try new stuff at the same time and switch when necessary.
    Learn to look for and use stable software the most if you don't want to waste time downgrading when something breaks.
    
18. Pragmatism is at the root of the philosophy of Arch Linux. Be pragmatic and not overly idealistic.

19. Don't install too much from the AUR, use only when the specific package is necessary. Try to look for alternatives from the official repos.
    (Eg. fbgrab instead of fbcat(AUR))

21. Avoid major Plasma (x.x.0) releases, they come with unplanned changes at first, wait for a few more point releases and then upgrade.
    - But speaking of that, any major release in free software isn't always the stable smooth software upgrade you may think it'd be.
    If things break, rollback using ALA to the date before the plasma update release on the repos.
    
    Add to, in pacman.conf to this effect(see example below) the related packagegroups and packages related to KDE
    and all other qt tools(since Plasma depends on those libraries as well as other qt tools and apps, 
    breakage is possible if you upgrade either to the latest qt library or package but not both(such as in the case of qbittorrent)
    [NOTE: Partial upgrades are not supported, use at your own risk and without any official support]:
    
    (What is presented here is only for example purposes, you may use them for your own, but understand first what it does before doing so)
    #IgnorePkg = *qt *qt6 qbittorrent
    #firefox linux linux-zen linux-lts shared-mime-info
    #IgnoreGroup = qt6 plasma kf6 kde-applications
    Add the second line to avoid downgrading major and stable packages from the archive like the kernel(see (6))
    
22. NO, GNOME is not BLOATED. It's very simple and is lesser in size than even KDE Plasma.
    People just complain about its looks and workings and it is catered for a specific kind of general user-base with simplicity at it's core.
    It's also very stable, unless if you use extensions which are community based, you can install them system-wide from the AUR
    or the few from the official repos, although it's best to install them user-wide with extension-manager(AUR)
    See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME

    From personal experience, it's smoother. Could be placebo but food for thought. 

Always try new stuff. Good luck and happy journey fellow Archer.


[PROTIPS]

Want to remove stuff from your bash history?
    Use history -d [fromlinenumber-tolinenumber]

Use kde-gtk-config and set to breeze to achieve GTK and Qt harmony across apps when using KDE with Breeze.
    See, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uniform_look_for_Qt_and_GTK_applications
Set widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker to 1 in Firefox instead of 2 to use KDE file picker.
Install plasma5-integration if you need Plasma 5/Qt5 apps to work nice with Plamsa 6, personally it wasn't of much use.

Enable GPU passthrough in BIOS for use with QEMU/KVM with virt-manager to use VMs more efficiently and make use of 3D acceleration.

Recommendations:
- GParted is the best when it comes to GUI partitioning. cfdisk in terminal.

- Geany, light-weight IDE similar to VScode, installable in official repos. Check out vscodium(AUR)

- gThumb, comfy image viewer with video play support along with a few image editing basic tools.

- BalenaEtcher(from github for 64bit builds) for easy Linux live CD flashing. For Windows, Rufus of course.

- Install DXVK and GalliumNine(A bit buggy, you can use DXVK instead for DX9 if you don't want GalliumNine) for performance improvements with wine.

- OBS for screen recording, install obs-vkcapture(AUR) for game capture. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Open_Broadcaster_Software

- Use dolphin-plugins for tools like, easy iso mounting in dolphin file manager.
 
- Check out LXQt and Xfce for stable and lightweight retro looking Desktop Environments.

- Check out https://github.com/androlabs/emoji-archlinux for when you're installing noto-fonts-emoji and other fonts which also has a few emojis particularly monochrome that replace the ones in Noto Color Emoji when using them, a real bugger but this fixes it. Reinstall noto-fonts-emoji after to properly build fc-cache.
